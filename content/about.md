My interest in computers started as soon as I could read. Not long after, I've learned how program, starting with Sinclair Basic which even though is not that best programming experience it was fascinating to me as a child. As a result of such early interest, I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science. In my professional career I opted to apply my programming knowledge to different areas, like: CAD/CAM, Business Process Management, E-Commerce, and Intellectual Property. I've also worked in different roles, as DevOp, project manager, and with different programming languages which includes: C/C++, Java, Javascript, Ruby, Python, Lua, OCaml, among others.

I'm an avid learner, currently focused on learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and its Actor Model as an alternative to solving concurrent and distributed problems. As a benefit of that, I can use the [Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.org/) and [Absinthe](http://absinthe-graphql.org/) to learn more about [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). I'm also investing time in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) which provides and alternative way to write frontend code in a safer manner using several ideas from functional programming and modern static type systems. And lastly I'm learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as a safer alternative to C/C++, as it provides solid memory management and zero-costs abstractions, as well as first class support to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).

As my past experiences show, I've collected a lot of knowledge in different areas, some of those will be featured in my posts, but besides that, I will include a myriad of subjects of my personal interest, that includes storytelling and screenwriting, cooking and mixology, comics and books, along with random stories about life in general.
